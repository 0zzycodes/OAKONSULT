            nor height nor depth, nor any other created thing, shall be able to

            <br /> Beyond Suffering Course has been designed by the Joni and
            Friends Ministry (USA) to explore the problem of suffering in
            general and then to examine ways in which the disability community
            provides the church with a dynamic model of spiritual
            transformation.

          Beyond Suffering Course (BYS) - A Christian Perspective to Disability
        </h1>
        <p>
          People with disabilities are considered one of the world’s largest
          under-represented groups.
          <br />
          <br /> The church is largely unprepared for the burgeoning disabled
          population.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Have you ever suffered physically, emotionally, or spiritually and
            wondered why?
          </li>
          <li>
            Do you have family members or friends with disabilities and struggle
            to know what to say or how to act around them?
